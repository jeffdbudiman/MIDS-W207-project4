She has a job lined up with a call center but doesn't start for 2 months (she has to wait for the next training classes to start). \n\n**So yes, long term, she will be OK.**\n\nThe problem, is that DES hasn't approved her application yet (she has not been in the state long) and she and her husband are skipping eating meals days at a time. Thankfully she is still managing for her children, at the expense of her and her husband eating. I am just looking for a meal to help her get to next week, where I am pretty sure she will be OK (and I will be able to lend further aid at that point if she isn't).

I'd like to request a pizza for my partner of 7 years. I think it'd be a really nice surprise for him and he loves Reddit as much as I do, so it'd give him one heck of a smile. If you're interested, I want to provide some history so you know where I'm coming from and why I'd like to see that smile. I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)\n\nAbout 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.\n\nAfter about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago. \n\nIt's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing. \n\nBy the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).\n\nI met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc. \n\nFor his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.\n\nSo, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. \n\nI hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. \n\nFast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.\n\nI try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.\n\nOne day I promise to pay it forward. Here's a picture of my dog, Fizban and my partner:  http:\/\/imgur.com\/SoygY","request_text_edit_aware":"Hi Everyone!\n\nFirst time requester here and thanks for reading.

I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)\n\nAbout 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.\n\nAfter about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago. \n\nIt's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing. \n\nBy the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).\n\nI met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc. \n\nFor his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.\n\nSo, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. \n\nI hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. \n\nFast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.\n\nI try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.\n\nOne day I promise to pay it forward. Here's a picture of my dog, Fizban and my partner:  http:\/\/imgur.com\/SoygY","request_title":"[Request] In Chicago with a request, though not for me...","requester_account_age_in_days_at_request":254.4259953704,"requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval":1032.0993055556,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request":0.0,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval":777.6316435185,"requester_number_of_comments_at_request":84,"requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval":494,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval":6,"requester_number_of_posts_at_request":11,"requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval":44,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval":1,"requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request":21,"requester_received_pizza":true,"requester_subreddits_at_request":["AdviceAnimals","AskReddit","HeroesofNewerth","LGBTrees","WTF","askscience","aww","chicago","conspiracy","funny","gaming","occupywallstreet","pics","politics","reddit.com","science","space","starcraft","todayilearned","trees","worldnews"],"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request":512,"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval":9174,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request":936,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval":57014,"requester_user_flair":"shroom","requester_username":"heybigpancakes","unix_timestamp_of_request":1319130233,"unix_timestamp_of_request_utc":1319126633,"len_request_text":819,"num_punct_request_text":141,"num_emoticons_request_text":2,"len_request_text_edit_aware":819,"num_punct_request_text_edit_aware":141,"num_emoticons_request_text_edit_aware":2,"len_request_title":10,"num_punct_request_title":6,"num_emoticons_request_title":0,"request_text_cleaned":"hi everyon first time request thank read id like request pizza partner 7 year think itd realli nice surpris love reddit much itd give one heck smile your interest want provid histori know im come id like see smile ill tri provid enough context without verbos about 3 year ago lost job market breadwinn relationship work fun realli set find anoth job start recess didnt go well after year unemploy live save look anoth job would pay enough pay bill big concern stop take lot job due pay requir servic debt oblig realiz hate 25 2 year ago it strang hard describ think unless youv gone someth similar work hard ever sinc 13 paper rout earn coupl hundr month 16 got job best buy that career sale took sold best buy floor year went compusa work commiss sale guy first commiss job 17 made realli good money continu progress retail retail market by time enter colleg make peopl colleg year number went everi year kind money blind fact wasnt enjoy enjoy make spend money much burn faster made realli thing fun though drop colleg probabl good thing sinc go degre wouldnt want now i met partner myspac time gotten first manag posit travel 90 time first coupl year great gone much like long honeymoon sometim hed come vega nyc seattl etc for part work never big deal made lot money hed alway work odd retail job hour stuff custom servic stuff never made 10 hour held job half year didnt care id rather spend time home work make coupl extra buck so back thre year ago lost job year come dri fell pretti bad depress couldnt find work would pay bill realiz didnt even like work affect relationship dramat retreat world warcraft stop talk famili eventu money ran bill stop get paid i hit bottom long dark period thank bottom nice soft pillow peopl love parent step help get tough financi partn step support mental financi fast forward today partner happili employ 1 year anniversari month compani provid promis career opportun love weve downsiz live car eat cheap stay cook weve move studio apart partn work save go school someth love vet even got chocol labrador puppi februari name fizban hes constant sourc joy person 3 year ago would recogn person today i tri nice thing whenev possibl lessen stress sole earner hous that request starv live tight would delici treat us partn found came gener person reddit amaz one day promis pay forward here pictur dog fizban partner httimgurcomsoygi","request_title_cleaned":"request in chicago with a request though not for me","request_text_vader_senti":{"neg":0.05,"neu":0.817,"pos":0.133,"compound":0.998},"request_text_vader_neg":0.05,"request_text_vader_pos":0.133,"request_text_vader_neu":0.817,"request_title_vader_senti":{"neg":0.0,"neu":1.0,"pos":0.0,"compound":0.0},"request_title_vader_neg":0.0,"request_title_vader_pos":0.0,"request_title_vader_neu":1.0}

A little more right now since I'm in this house by myself.\n\nIf anyone thinks I'm a troll\/scammer, I'd be happy to give you the name of my primary reddit name in private and verify through there and\/or through the verification system.\n\nFYI, I'm in the U.S., if that matters to anyone.\n\nThanks, guys and gals.","request_title":"First time requesting - throwaway acct","requester_account_age_in_days_at_request":0.0,"requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval":861.353912037,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request":0.0,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval":861.353912037,"requester_number_of_comments_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval":0,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval":0,"requester_number_of_posts_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval":1,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval":1,"requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request":0,"requester_received_pizza":false,"requester_subreddits_at_request":[],"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request":0,"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval":1,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request":0,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval":7,"requester_user_flair":null,"requester_username":"StartingOverFresh","unix_timestamp_of_request":1311896805,"unix_timestamp_of_request_utc":1311893205,"len_request_text":193,"num_punct_request_text":45,"num_emoticons_request_text":0,"len_request_text_edit_aware":193,"num_punct_request_text_edit_aware":45,"num_emoticons_request_text_edit_aware":0,"len_request_title":6,"num_punct_request_title":1,"num_emoticons_request_title":0,"request_text_cleaned":"wife amp split good gone weekend spend time famili bit use throwaway havent notifi friend amp famili yet situat know peopl know primari reedit account amic split doesnt make instant easi either that said rough emot sell hous rough especi natur economi us point expect sell i could probabl spare 10 small medium pizza im realli tri save everi penni help cost plus right lot thing feel like suck littl right sinc im hous myself if anyon think im trollscamm id happi give name primari reddit name privat verifi andor verif system fyi im us matter anyon thank guy gal","request_title_cleaned":"first time request throwaway acct","request_text_vader_senti":{"neg":0.015,"neu":0.835,"pos":0.15,"compound":0.9827},"request_text_vader_neg":0.015,"request_text_vader_pos":0.15,"request_text_vader_neu":0.835,"request_title_vader_senti":{"neg":0.0,"neu":1.0,"pos":0.0,"compound":0.0},"request_title_vader_neg":0.0,"request_title_vader_pos":0.0,"request_title_vader_neu":1.0}

I'm a 24 year old college student from South-West Sydney, working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills, and just moved into a shared accommodation. Things weren't always this difficult. I had a girlfriend live with me, so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.\n\nBut now that I've been single for a year, and trying to make my way through college, things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had, and my credit cards are shot. I still have at least another year in college, but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.\n\nI rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages, and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day, because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently, just so I can save money on haircuts. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now, and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.\n\nIt's kind of depressing actually. I never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.\n\nI must admit, I had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza Reddit before, but long story short... I'm starving. I'm very embarrassed to ask anyone, as I don't want people to know how poor I am. However, if someone could help a brother out, I would forever be in-debt.

She gave me a fairly large 'thank you' kiss and said \"I thought you forgot!\".\n\n\nShe took the note off of the fake pepperoni and read it. \"I will love you until the last pepperoni fades.\" she starting crying like she just won the lottery.\n\n---- Now, fast forwarding 5 years later, we are still happily together and enjoying our youth, but her birthday is today and I plan to have dinner with her this evening.\n\n\nI would love to see someone else kind enough to pass down a pizza to a young couple in love.","request_title":"[Request] Story of Pizza and Love","requester_account_age_in_days_at_request":435.6655671296,"requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval":819.0546296296,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request":435.6655671296,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval":819.0546296296,"requester_number_of_comments_at_request":4,"requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval":6,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request":4,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval":6,"requester_number_of_posts_at_request":1,"requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval":2,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request":1,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval":2,"requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request":1,"requester_received_pizza":false,"requester_subreddits_at_request":["Random_Acts_Of_Pizza"],"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request":9,"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval":12,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request":23,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval":26,"requester_user_flair":null,"requester_username":"Sabromex","unix_timestamp_of_request":1353192952,"unix_timestamp_of_request_utc":1353192952,"len_request_text":552,"num_punct_request_text":96,"num_emoticons_request_text":0,"len_request_text_edit_aware":552,"num_punct_request_text_edit_aware":96,"num_emoticons_request_text_edit_aware":0,"len_request_title":6,"num_punct_request_title":2,"num_emoticons_request_title":0,"request_text_cleaned":"hello roap want go small amount detail post tell guy much love keep post appropri possibl amount detail ill go to i girlfriend 18th birthday realli want go arcad new coupl cours im tri look cool front say someth along line alright realli want realli want shout top excit sure your birthday mine love arcad wooooo so arcad play goofi silli game like game put quarter watch quarter go pile quarter metal bar might push quarter prize pit anyway fun so eventu go littl girl room forget bring phone took phone start count ticket sudden phone get text pictur best friend face pop screen dont like go peopl text see word toni put phone back pocket first name\nso read 1 text states\ntoni better rememb ask last week\nmi stomach got twist feel oh crap could forget just pizza deliveri guy pizza place right next door walk car leav rush scream hey wait ask kind pizza much paid full plus 10 tip ask hold pizza minut ran across street joke shop bought gag sausag dont ask one wasnt pay attent time i took gag sausag back pizza took pocket knife cut slice small enough look similar pepperoni next took pen paper wrote note pin candl top shes walk bathroom start sing happi birthday peopl around room join clap blew candl she ear ear smile die gave fair larg thank kiss said thought forgot she took note fake pepperoni read love last pepperoni fade start cri like lotteri fast forward 5 year later still happili togeth enjoy youth birthday today plan dinner even i would love see someon els kind enough pass pizza young coupl love","request_title_cleaned":"request stori of pizza and love","request_text_vader_senti":{"neg":0.053,"neu":0.802,"pos":0.145,"compound":0.9952},"request_text_vader_neg":0.053,"request_text_vader_pos":0.145,"request_text_vader_neu":0.802,"request_title_vader_senti":{"neg":0.0,"neu":0.543,"pos":0.457,"compound":0.6369},"request_title_vader_neg":0.0,"request_title_vader_pos":0.457,"request_title_vader_neu":0.543}

Thank you so much! http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza\/comments\/1g3me0\/thanks_iamseth_your_generosity_fills_our_hearts\/\n\nIt's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  \n\nIn exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.

And now she has to suffer for my screw up.\n\nAs I stated [I have Paypal cash](http:\/\/imgur.com\/2AO2c), but I do not have a paypal debit card, If someone would want to do a trade I'd appreciate it. If anyone can help but does not have a Paypal I can send you a [$25 Bath and body works GC](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/UCUvL#0). It is my fault that I did not plan things correctly, and this is my last option for today to make things right for my daughter. I am not in any way shape or form asking for a handout or a freebie, I just want to make a simple trade so my daughter and I can eat tonight. I'm not posting on my real account because I'm ashamed that things turned out this way and I feel I should only be here to help and not to be helped. But I can do a trade and pay it forward to make it up. If you want any more proof please don't hesitate to ask, I can give my account name and more picture, even a picture of my state ID.

A pepperoni + bell pepper pie from someone would really give me a little hope.\n\nThanks for reading...","request_title":"[Request] Just a humble request\/story, a million thanks just for reading.","requester_account_age_in_days_at_request":612.2563194444,"requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval":1161.812974537,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request":0.0,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval":549.5149884259,"requester_number_of_comments_at_request":160,"requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval":281,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval":0,"requester_number_of_posts_at_request":24,"requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval":57,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval":1,"requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request":35,"requester_received_pizza":false,"requester_subreddits_at_request":["AdviceAnimals","AskReddit","Buddhism","FL_Studio","FinalFantasy","House","IAmA","MTGTournaments","Music","OFWGKTA","Poetry","WTF","WeAreTheMusicMakers","atheism","firstworldproblems","funny","gaming","hiphopheads","islam","japanese","lgbt","magicTCG","malefashionadvice","pics","politics","reddit.com","ronpaul","science","tattoos","technology","treemusic","trees","worldnews","wow","writing"],"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request":489,"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval":1022,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request":1437,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval":2528,"requester_user_flair":null,"requester_username":"omfgtom","unix_timestamp_of_request":1338839598,"unix_timestamp_of_request_utc":1338835998,"len_request_text":250,"num_punct_request_text":41,"num_emoticons_request_text":0,"len_request_text_edit_aware":250,"num_punct_request_text_edit_aware":41,"num_emoticons_request_text_edit_aware":0,"len_request_title":11,"num_punct_request_title":5,"num_emoticons_request_title":0,"request_text_cleaned":"hey raop ive pretti late dark thought go head think big part uncl live suspect bladder cancer cant describ put context unfortun famili mean cancer usual horribl top hardship famili face absolut devast uncl mother support grandmoth live fair small hous im one low wage retail job im work go school soon get aliv thing stress usual wake peopl argu yell car nee new transmiss nee ton dental work realli dont feel like go lot time stay posit tri reflect fact work make good grade so hope didnt bore didnt get detail pizza someon feel like get one would cool broke friday dont much food also roach lot food contamin ugh pepperoni bell pepper pie someon would realli give littl hope thank read","request_title_cleaned":"request just a humbl requeststori a million thank just for read","request_text_vader_senti":{"neg":0.141,"neu":0.735,"pos":0.124,"compound":-0.7192},"request_text_vader_neg":0.141,"request_text_vader_pos":0.124,"request_text_vader_neu":0.735,"request_title_vader_senti":{"neg":0.0,"neu":0.775,"pos":0.225,"compound":0.4404},"request_title_vader_neg":0.0,"request_title_vader_pos":0.225,"request_title_vader_neu":0.775}
