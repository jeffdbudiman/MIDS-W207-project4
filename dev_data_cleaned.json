Around Christmas, I did just that - sank like a stone. I fell into a major depressive episode that last months, culminating in what I can only describe as a mental breakdown over Easter. I became dependent on weed, never leaving my room or spending time sober other than to go to work on Sundays, and then I'd come home and get high again. Obviously, I dropped out of university.\n\nThis, obviously, was a massive waste of money. It also didn't help that I'd lent one of my now ex-housemates \u00a3100 to help him pay his rent, which I know now that I will never see again (we live and learn). I have a \u00a3970 overdraft that is all gone, and although I've at least paid my rent for this month, I won't be getting paid until the end of August. I also have to pay a week worth of council tax (only \u00a330 but too much for me) for the week before I enrolled, or I'll have a court date, and \u00a340 of library fees tomorrow, but luckily my mum is bailing me out for that (she already bailed me out of last month's rent, so I already owe her \u00a3500).\n\nI've had to start working full time, eat butter sandwiches at work because it is all I can afford, and improvise for dinner (or just not eat). I'm extremely skinny anyway, and cannot afford this weight loss.\n\nI spend four hours commuting a day (I work in West London), come home, eat, sleep, get up at 6am to go to work again...I feel very lonely at the moment, and a cheesy, greasy pizza with meat or something would go a long way to providing me with a little comfort at the moment.\n\nSorry for spilling this all out, I only meant to give a short sum out, but have ended up providing you with an essay! I'm not known for being concise...\n\nBut yes, a pizza would be so very appreciated, and if the offerer wanted, I can return the pizza favour once I get paid. I would just like some meat and cheese in my life right now haha.

Could really go for a tasty pizza when I get off of work just to cheer me up, and will pay it forward hopefully on the 3rd when I get paid again. \n Thanks for reading.","request_title":"[Request] Iowan Looking for Some Pizza","requester_account_age_in_days_at_request":81.9525231481,"requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval":308.6346875,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request":0.0,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval":226.6404976852,"requester_number_of_comments_at_request":103,"requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval":755,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval":5,"requester_number_of_posts_at_request":2,"requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval":15,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval":2,"requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request":14,"requester_received_pizza":true,"requester_subreddits_at_request":["AskReddit","DatingHell","FearMe","IAmA","LetsNotMeet","Paranormal","Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","aww","buildapcforme","cringe","cringepics","politics","popping","todayilearned"],"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request":278,"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval":1659,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request":350,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval":1947,"requester_user_flair":"shroom","requester_username":"Drynian","unix_timestamp_of_request":1366735861,"unix_timestamp_of_request_utc":1366732261,"len_request_text":98,"num_punct_request_text":12,"num_emoticons_request_text":0,"len_request_text_edit_aware":98,"num_punct_request_text_edit_aware":12,"num_emoticons_request_text_edit_aware":0,"len_request_title":6,"num_punct_request_title":2,"num_emoticons_request_title":0,"request_text_cleaned":"hello raop current sit desk work look checkbook regist sigh fact 185 left last may 3rd yesterday spent last littl bit money birthday present daught turn 4 tomorrow also rain last week half could realli go tasti pizza get work cheer pay forward hope 3rd get paid thank read","request_title_cleaned":"request iowan look for some pizza","request_text_vader_senti":{"neg":0.014,"neu":0.9,"pos":0.086,"compound":0.8176},"request_text_vader_neg":0.014,"request_text_vader_pos":0.086,"request_text_vader_neu":0.9,"request_title_vader_senti":{"neg":0.0,"neu":1.0,"pos":0.0,"compound":0.0},"request_title_vader_neg":0.0,"request_title_vader_pos":0.0,"request_title_vader_neu":1.0}

Car broke down at the beginning of the month, which means I've been busing until payday on Friday. My Grammy passed away suddenly from complications from lung cancer on January 11th. Being alone in WA meant a very complicated and extended grieving process as I couldn't get down to Oregon until the day before the funeral. Came back up and found that on top of my car being broken down, my tire went flat as it sat there completely still and parked meaning I'll have to get it fixed and replace a tire now. Then yesterday I was on Skype with my boyfriend who is an Airman and already far away in Omaha and he got orders. They're for Japan. And he leaves in April. We had plans for his leave in June. Those won't happen anymore. So today I am just sad and teary and majorly craving pizza. I do promise to hop back on after Payday and pay it forward, I know how much a pizza can brighten a day!","request_title":"[Request]Bit of a tough month, would love a cheer-up pizza in Lynnwood, WA","requester_account_age_in_days_at_request":276.0463773148,"requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval":585.5297337963,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request":0.0,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval":309.4833564815,"requester_number_of_comments_at_request":8,"requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval":11,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval":0,"requester_number_of_posts_at_request":3,"requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval":4,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval":1,"requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request":7,"requester_received_pizza":false,"requester_subreddits_at_request":["AskReddit","DressExchange","Random_Acts_Of_Pizza","aww","freebies","gonewild","running"],"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request":264,"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval":263,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request":430,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval":449,"requester_user_flair":null,"requester_username":"crazyredhead87","unix_timestamp_of_request":1359578431,"unix_timestamp_of_request_utc":1359578431,"len_request_text":203,"num_punct_request_text":26,"num_emoticons_request_text":0,"len_request_text_edit_aware":203,"num_punct_request_text_edit_aware":26,"num_emoticons_request_text_edit_aware":0,"len_request_title":13,"num_punct_request_title":5,"num_emoticons_request_title":0,"request_text_cleaned":"hey redditor it awhil sinc ive januari realli rough month im pretti crap day here januari went car broke begin month mean ive buse payday friday grammi pass away sudden complic lung cancer januari 11th alon wa meant complic extend griev process couldnt get oregon day funer came back found top car broken tire went flat sat complet still park mean ill get fix replac tire yesterday skype boyfriend airman alreadi far away omaha got order theyr japan leav april plan leav june wont happen anymor today sad teari major crave pizza promis hop back payday pay forward know much pizza brighten day","request_title_cleaned":"requestbit of a tough month would love a cheerup pizza in lynnwood wa","request_text_vader_senti":{"neg":0.118,"neu":0.837,"pos":0.045,"compound":-0.9381},"request_text_vader_neg":0.118,"request_text_vader_pos":0.045,"request_text_vader_neu":0.837,"request_title_vader_senti":{"neg":0.09,"neu":0.659,"pos":0.251,"compound":0.5719},"request_title_vader_neg":0.09,"request_title_vader_pos":0.251,"request_title_vader_neu":0.659}

But let me mention, I am NOT one to ask for assistance. But there comes times when we must swallow our pride.\n\nI have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325\/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.\n\nI've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.\n\nAlso, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.\n\nSo here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.\n\nNOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)\n\nEDIT: I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to put my location, and I kept saying it in my head. :P Anyways, I'm in South Florida, right by Ft.

We will offer drawings of pizza, or anything that you like in return for this awesome bday gift. \n\nLove _ Mama Bear and Her 2 Lil Cubs, Brantley and Brianna","request_title":"[Request] It's my twins 5th Birthday today!","requester_account_age_in_days_at_request":0.0,"requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval":781.419224537,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request":0.0,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval":781.419224537,"requester_number_of_comments_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval":2,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval":2,"requester_number_of_posts_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval":1,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval":1,"requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request":0,"requester_received_pizza":false,"requester_subreddits_at_request":[],"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request":0,"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval":1,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request":0,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval":11,"requester_user_flair":null,"requester_username":"Loveyoutwice","unix_timestamp_of_request":1318803047,"unix_timestamp_of_request_utc":1318799447,"len_request_text":118,"num_punct_request_text":17,"num_emoticons_request_text":0,"len_request_text_edit_aware":118,"num_punct_request_text_edit_aware":17,"num_emoticons_request_text_edit_aware":0,"len_request_title":7,"num_punct_request_title":4,"num_emoticons_request_title":0,"request_text_cleaned":"today twin 5th birthday today couldnt afford get present situat right friend suggest check site kidslov pizza librari right hope someon help get us pizza mama bear repay back help get soon new reddit randomactsofpizza feel give lot mama bear get back feet offer draw pizza anyth like return awesom bday gift love mama bear 2 lil cub brantley brianna","request_title_cleaned":"request it my twin 5th birthday today","request_text_vader_senti":{"neg":0.009,"neu":0.761,"pos":0.23,"compound":0.9848},"request_text_vader_neg":0.009,"request_text_vader_pos":0.23,"request_text_vader_neu":0.761,"request_title_vader_senti":{"neg":0.0,"neu":1.0,"pos":0.0,"compound":0.0},"request_title_vader_neg":0.0,"request_title_vader_pos":0.0,"request_title_vader_neu":1.0}

We have an 8 month old who is a high risk infant so she gets a monthly RSV shot to prevent her from getting the nasty virus. She's been a handful since yesterday :(\n\nI've never requested a pizza here before and we aren't really the types to splurge on eating takeout. But if I had the money I'd do it today, as it would raise our spirits. I just got my verification code so if anyone can hook it up I would greatly appreciate it! I would also pay it forward as soon as I'd be able to :)\n\nThanks &lt;3\n\n","request_title":"[Request] Me want a pizza pie!

I tried to post yesterday but it never showed up in the thread. :( ","request_title":"[Request] Pessimism dies hard &amp; 1st world problems...","requester_account_age_in_days_at_request":154.8298958333,"requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval":279.2758449074,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request":9.8184606481,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval":134.2644097222,"requester_number_of_comments_at_request":22,"requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval":26,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request":2,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval":2,"requester_number_of_posts_at_request":3,"requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval":5,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval":1,"requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request":6,"requester_received_pizza":false,"requester_subreddits_at_request":["AskReddit","IAmA","Random_Acts_Of_Pizza","casualiama","funny","penpals"],"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request":602,"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval":613,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request":810,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval":829,"requester_user_flair":null,"requester_username":"ObscureAgain","unix_timestamp_of_request":1375569142,"unix_timestamp_of_request_utc":1375565542,"len_request_text":208,"num_punct_request_text":26,"num_emoticons_request_text":2,"len_request_text_edit_aware":208,"num_punct_request_text_edit_aware":26,"num_emoticons_request_text_edit_aware":2,"len_request_title":8,"num_punct_request_title":7,"num_emoticons_request_title":0,"request_text_cleaned":"realli encourag subreddit still bit disbeliev random stranger will help one anoth major pessimist tri almost alway tend think worst eventu happen given moment suppos start onlin class master degre monday actual ship comput repair serious mess warranti end 10 day sigh much inconveni go librari etc feel like anytim take step forward get kick two step back a hot pizza saturday night would pick spirit bit husband would also definit enjoy work cook alway exhaust come home last thing want cook dinner bit kitchen nightmar thank guy edit near milwauke wi tri post yesterday never show thread ","request_title_cleaned":"request pessim die hard amp 1st world problem","request_text_vader_senti":{"neg":0.126,"neu":0.78,"pos":0.094,"compound":-0.8666},"request_text_vader_neg":0.126,"request_text_vader_pos":0.094,"request_text_vader_neu":0.78,"request_title_vader_senti":{"neg":0.569,"neu":0.431,"pos":0.0,"compound":-0.6808},"request_title_vader_neg":0.569,"request_title_vader_pos":0.0,"request_title_vader_neu":0.431}

I can't purchase digital downloads, gift cards, subscribe &amp; save, or Amazon Prime according to the Amazon help.","request_title":"[Request] Hungry sixteen year old dude stuck at school for another hour and a half","requester_account_age_in_days_at_request":31.1158333333,"requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval":685.4366435185,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request":13.100162037,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval":667.4209722222,"requester_number_of_comments_at_request":18,"requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval":30,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request":8,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval":17,"requester_number_of_posts_at_request":3,"requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval":6,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request":1,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval":3,"requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request":6,"requester_received_pizza":false,"requester_subreddits_at_request":["AdviceAnimals","AnnArbor","Random_Acts_Of_Pizza","WTF","blog","fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu"],"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request":59,"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval":85,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request":139,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval":169,"requester_user_flair":null,"requester_username":"verygenericusername","unix_timestamp_of_request":1329784418,"unix_timestamp_of_request_utc":1329784418,"len_request_text":186,"num_punct_request_text":85,"num_emoticons_request_text":3,"len_request_text_edit_aware":186,"num_punct_request_text_edit_aware":85,"num_emoticons_request_text_edit_aware":3,"len_request_title":15,"num_punct_request_title":2,"num_emoticons_request_title":0,"request_text_cleaned":"7am code websit wake 830am resum code 12pm friend smoke came around 3pm couldnt go class way tire im starv cant go home anoth hour half anoth hour get home anyway ill someth pizza tell want that someth could includ amazon purchas 1028 1028 stuck mturk account transf gift card balanc purchas someth youd like dont bank account withdraw believ turn onlin gift card amazonhttpswwwamazoncomgpgcorderrefgcdpconvorderieutf8ampcasinb004llikvuamptypeemailampdesignagenericwhite10us want 1028 amazon credit pizza edit turn turn amazon gift card youd like purchas someth though cant purchas digit download gift card subscrib amp save amazon prim accord amazon help","request_title_cleaned":"request hungri sixteen year old dude stuck at school for anoth hour and a half","request_text_vader_senti":{"neg":0.059,"neu":0.702,"pos":0.239,"compound":0.9902},"request_text_vader_neg":0.059,"request_text_vader_pos":0.239,"request_text_vader_neu":0.702,"request_title_vader_senti":{"neg":0.125,"neu":0.875,"pos":0.0,"compound":-0.25},"request_title_vader_neg":0.125,"request_title_vader_pos":0.0,"request_title_vader_neu":0.875}

I will be happy to pay the pizza forward next month when I get my first paycheck.\nThank you.","request_title":"[Request] Veggie Pizza for In Debt Couple paying Medical Bills in Austin, TX","requester_account_age_in_days_at_request":49.0745717593,"requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval":717.3744907407,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request":0.0,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval":668.2999189815,"requester_number_of_comments_at_request":3,"requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval":5,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval":1,"requester_number_of_posts_at_request":1,"requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval":2,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval":1,"requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request":3,"requester_received_pizza":false,"requester_subreddits_at_request":["Random_Acts_Of_Pizza","legaladvice","stopdrinking"],"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request":9,"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval":11,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request":15,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval":17,"requester_user_flair":null,"requester_username":"whoopdippitydooda","unix_timestamp_of_request":1328576687,"unix_timestamp_of_request_utc":1328576687,"len_request_text":170,"num_punct_request_text":16,"num_emoticons_request_text":0,"len_request_text_edit_aware":170,"num_punct_request_text_edit_aware":16,"num_emoticons_request_text_edit_aware":0,"len_request_title":13,"num_punct_request_title":3,"num_emoticons_request_title":0,"request_text_cleaned":"hi\ni surgeri thre month ago reconstruct acl meniscus physic natur job unabl work past thre month although start back week past week hooray insur pay much bill thank bill pay wipe us put us debt money bank account friday husband get paid meantim food pantri rice bean weve eat everi singl night week\niv never ask assist feel slight unworthi peopl food pantri still anyon spare us pizza tonight wed grate vegetarian pleas meat happi pay pizza forward next month get first paycheck\nthank","request_title_cleaned":"request veggi pizza for in debt coupl pay medic bill in austin tx","request_text_vader_senti":{"neg":0.113,"neu":0.78,"pos":0.107,"compound":0.4346},"request_text_vader_neg":0.113,"request_text_vader_pos":0.107,"request_text_vader_neu":0.78,"request_title_vader_senti":{"neg":0.149,"neu":0.657,"pos":0.193,"compound":0.186},"request_title_vader_neg":0.149,"request_title_vader_pos":0.193,"request_title_vader_neu":0.657}

Of course, my boyfriend seemed pretty pissed about it when I told him my mom suggested this idea so, thanks mom, you're probably going to be the cause of our first fight.\n\nAnyway, it's gonna be a terrible few days for him and I'd like to make sure he has a tasty meal after a long trip and to say \"I'm sorry that my mom's crazy and I can't do anything about it.\"  His house is in Oakland so I'd suggest Sorento (4126219129 cheap and decent quality) or Antoons (4126875446 cheaper but more meh pizza) since they are local and cheap.\n\nAlso, since I'm getting my first paycheck in June 30th, I'll make sure to donate a pizza.  \n","request_title":"[REQUEST] Boyfriend's visiting and had it rough.

If a kind stranger could throw some food my way, I'd be very appreciative!\n\n\nIn return, I give one of my favourite Internet reads\n\nhttp:\/\/www.omegleconversations.com\/urinate-in-catless-peace.html\n\nand also my steam name: [eiramasil] and SC2 information [eira.506] because I'd love to be able to game with anyone who helps me out.\n\n\nThanks and have a great week ~","request_title":"[REQUEST] Ontario, Canada - transitional pizza?","requester_account_age_in_days_at_request":348.367037037,"requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval":1129.0816087963,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request":0.0,"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval":780.6729050926,"requester_number_of_comments_at_request":45,"requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval":46,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval":1,"requester_number_of_posts_at_request":2,"requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval":3,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request":0,"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval":1,"requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request":10,"requester_received_pizza":true,"requester_subreddits_at_request":["AskReddit","Minecraft","WTF","atheism","fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","gaming","reddit.com","secretsanta","starcraft","trees"],"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request":289,"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval":306,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request":725,"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval":742,"requester_user_flair":"shroom","requester_username":"eira_","unix_timestamp_of_request":1318867463,"unix_timestamp_of_request_utc":1318863863,"len_request_text":146,"num_punct_request_text":45,"num_emoticons_request_text":1,"len_request_text_edit_aware":146,"num_punct_request_text_edit_aware":45,"num_emoticons_request_text_edit_aware":1,"len_request_title":6,"num_punct_request_title":5,"num_emoticons_request_title":0,"request_text_cleaned":"hi reddit first id like say love subreddit visit everi se kind toward stranger alway make feel good even support upvot make smile keep bros im ask pizza ive move new town recent month tedious job search ive final manag find fulltim posit yay took month dont start work tomorrow payday least week away kind strang could throw food way id appreci in return give one favourit internet read httwwwomegleconversationscomurinateincatlesspeacehtml and also steam name eiramasil sc2 inform eira506 id love abl game anyon help out thank great week ","request_title_cleaned":"request ontario canada transit pizza","request_text_vader_senti":{"neg":0.0,"neu":0.766,"pos":0.234,"compound":0.9914},"request_text_vader_neg":0.0,"request_text_vader_pos":0.234,"request_text_vader_neu":0.766,"request_title_vader_senti":{"neg":0.0,"neu":1.0,"pos":0.0,"compound":0.0},"request_title_vader_neg":0.0,"request_title_vader_pos":0.0,"request_title_vader_neu":1.0}

Been going through some rough times lately. My mother passed exactly a year ago this week (February 13th, 2011), due to colon cancer at the young age of 55, sadly I cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much I miss her, but I'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway, the soul has moved on and I'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. Me and my father haven't been getting along either, he is an alcoholic, anger-ridden man.. Ana and I couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him, to help him with bills and whatnot, and he constantly berated me. I'm not sure why he is the way he is, but I think it has something to do with his mother. When I was 12 I was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it, in the meanest possible ways. So I'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. Suffice it to say, living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. Ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there, we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. He started screaming and calling me names like always, telling us that we're no longer welcome, telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then I decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a \"dick\"  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book, BAD move. I don't know how he heard me from the hallway, but he did. He slammed the door open, knocking over Ana's desktop computer, knocking over the desk it was set up on, and also knocking her over into our bed. He grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out, much to Ana's dismay, she was crying and screaming at him the whole time, telling him to stop and let me go, trying to pull him off of me. Afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. This was her idea. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever gotten concerning my father. Leave. Leave and never look back. He is not safe to be around. He is not a good person. So to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. I'm not sure if this was all TMI but I really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. Ana is my hero, she really is, she is beautiful and she makes me feel like I'm actually worth caring about. If you've read this far, thank you so much.\n\nBut alas! Some good news! We both just landed new jobs yesterday. We both got hired as sales people at Sears... I know not much, but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. I'm an IT guy, actually I'm more of a helpdesk-break\/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but I also have worked IT jobs. We do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. We don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day, no joke- [www.lctabus.com\/](www.lctabus.com\/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. In fact, we still haven't paid our security deposit, luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. So clearly there is no money for pizza. Which is upsetting, since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food, hands down. If someone can be help, we'll be sure to share it with our little puppy Horatio, who is the most adorable dog in the world,  he just turned 3 on valentines day! Here's a picture of me and him: ([Horatio and Bill](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ohDJi.jpg)) , and for good measure here is a picture of my girlfriend\/his mommy: ([Ana](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qHmZL.jpg)) . Anyway... we will be sure to take pictures and post them, as long as they come out nice and she doesn't hate the way she looks in them. Either way we will be sure to make some sort of post thanking you. She's actually at orientation right now and I've got online training to do. Thank god we still have the internet! We're so damn lucky that one of our neighbors has unprotected wi-fi, otherwise we wouldn't get our daily Reddit fix. Sorry for the life story, just thought you should know the people who are requesting. We love you all.\n\n.\n\nPS: When we finally get our feet on the ground we will most definitely pay it forward.
